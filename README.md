# Literature Review on NLP Using SCOPUS Data

Overview  
This project involves conducting a comprehensive literature review on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using data retrieved from the SCOPUS academic database. The objective is to analyze and summarize trends in NLP-related research over the past decade.

Tasks
1.	Data Retrieval:  
  •	Develop a Python program to interface with the SCOPUS API.  
  •	Retrieve academic papers that mention "NLP" in the title, keywords, or abstract from the last 10 years.  
  •	Extract metadata including the title, authors, journal, keywords, publication year, and abstract.  
2.	Preprocessing:  
  •	Perform text preprocessing tasks including tokenization, lemmatization, and stop words removal.  
3.	Frequent Term Analysis:  
  •	Use TF-IDF to identify the most frequent terms.  
  •	Visualize the results using bar charts and word clouds.  
4.	Word2Vec Analysis:  
  •	Apply Word2Vec to find the most frequent terms.  
5.	Autoencoder Analysis:  
  •	Use an Autoencoder to identify the most important terms.  
6.	Comparison of Results:  
  •	Compare the results obtained from TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Autoencoder analyses.  
7.	Named Entity Recognition (NER):  
  •	Implement an NER algorithm to extract named entities.  
8.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  •	Conduct EDA to identify trends, such as the number of papers published per year and the most prolific authors.  
9.	Trend Analysis:  
  •	Identify the most frequent terms or concepts and analyze their trends over the past 10 years.  
  •	Find highly interdependent terms or concepts.  
10.	Summarization:  
  •	Summarize the abstracts of the retrieved papers.  
11.	Topic Modeling:  
  o	Use a GPT model for topic modeling through question answering.  
13.	Comparison of Trends:  
  •	Compare the trends identified in the frequent term analysis with those from the topic modeling.  
15.	Review Article:  
  •	Write a review article summarizing the trends in academic publications related to NLP.  

Requirements  
•	Python 3.x  
•	Access to the SCOPUS API  
•	Libraries: requests, json, csv, nltk, gensim, tensorflow/keras, matplotlib, wordcloud  

Usage
1.	Clone the repository.  
2.	Install the required libraries  
3.	Run the main script to retrieve data and perform analyses.
